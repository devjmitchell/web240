				<h2>A Quick Tip</h2>
				<p>Feel free to click around my website. You can use the navigation on the top of each page to quickly locate every other page. If you'd like to contact me, click on that link and fill out the form. Also, I've embedded some fun on the 'games' page. Have fun!

			<!--Main Text-->
			<p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website. On this page of my website I'd like to tell you a little about myself. On my 'experience' page I will be telling you some of my background and where I've been. Next, you will find a 'contact' page explaining how you can reach me. Finally, I have included a quick game that you can try out on the 'games' page. For now, I only have the one game, but there will be more to come in the future. 
			</p>
			<p>So, to start... I am 29 years old. I am married and have three great children (you can see some of their pictures around my website). I am also attending University of Phoenix (obviously, right?), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Software Engineering.
			</p>
			<p>I served over 9 years in the United States Marine Corps holding multiple leadership roles and supervising many projects and inspections. I’ve supervised up to 90 employees at a given time mentoring and guiding my Marines in their military career progression. I’ve had a major role in assuring my divisions have been prepared and ready for any mission or inspection. I’ve been recognized for taking leadership roles above my current rank as well as leading new programs to “on track” grades while other units were not able to do so. I attended and completed leadership courses for each rank I achieved along the way.
			</p>
			<p>Now that I am no longer serving my country in the U.S. Marine Corps I am always looking to advance and move forward with my career. I am currently attending University of Phoenix working toward my B.S. in Information Technology. I have held an "A" average while attending high school and college. I also spend much of my “free time” researching and learning more to help better myself in my professional life.
