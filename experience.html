			<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p>My current schedule at University of Phoenix puts me on target to finish my degree early 2016. I plan on doubling up on some classes so that I can finish my degree by the end of 2015. While pursuing my degree I'd like to continue working at Apollo Education Group. My current internship ends in August and I may be hired full time at that point. If not hired full time I will be pursuing an entry level position in project management or programming. As soon as I have my degree I expect to move into higher roles (and get a pay raise, too).
